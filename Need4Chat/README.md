# Blazor Chat Sample

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/conficient/Need4Chat/_apis/build/status/conficient.Need4Chat?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/conficient/Need4Chat/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)

> Now upgraded for [.NET core 3.2.0 preview 2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/blazor-webassembly-3-2-0-preview-2-release-now-available/) - please ensure you have installed the latest Blazor templates and VS 2019 preview.

This application demonstrates the use of [SignalR](https://www.asp.net/signalr) 
to create a [Blazor](https://blazor.net/) chat application.

### Now JavaScript-Free!

The SignalR client now works with Blazor WASM - so we can drop the 
JavaScript client at last. The app now uses the
`Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client` library which is now compatible 
with the Mono WASM runtime. This really simplifies the `ChatClient` code.

##### Known Issues

The [disconnect bug](https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/18628") in the mono implementation of WebSockets
    has now been fixed. When a client disconnects it correctly disposes and the event
    reflects in the other clients ("xxxx has left the chat").

If you want to see how the JavaScript client version worked, I've retained 
it in [this branch](https://github.com/conficient/Need4Chat/tree/netcore-3.2.0-preview1)

The .NET Client is much simpler to use as it no longer needs to use JSinterop and have a JS Client 
code to handle the interface to SignalR. 

### Other Changes

As well as removing JavaScript, I've refactored the client and hub code, moving both of 
these to a `Need4Chat.Interfaces` project.

## Demo
