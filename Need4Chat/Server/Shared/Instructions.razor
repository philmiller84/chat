<p>
    This application demonstrates the use of <a href="https://www.asp.net/signalr">SignalR</a>
    to create a <a href="https://blazor.net/">Blazor</a> chat application.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="badge badge-success">New</span> At last! The SignalR client now works with Blazor WASM - so we can drop
    the JavaScript client. The app now uses the <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client</code> library which
    is now compatible with the Mono WASM runtime.
</p>
<h5>Known Issues</h5>
<p>
    There is <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/18628">a bug</a> in the current mono implementation of WebSockets
    that means a connection does not close when SignalR closes and disposes a client. This used to trigger the
    <i>'xxx has left the chat'</i> messages on remaining clients. When this is fixed it should start working again.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to see how the JavaScript client version worked, I've retained it in
    [this branch](https://github.com/conficient/Need4Chat/tree/netcore-3.2.0-preview1)
</p>
<p>
    This version of the app has been updated for the 
    <a href='https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/blazor-webassembly-3-2-0-preview-1-release-now-available/'>.NET Core 3.2.0 Preview 1</a>
    version of Blazor.
